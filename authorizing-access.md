# How Patient Apps Use a CMS-Aligned Network for Record Location and Data Access

*This page shows how a patient-facing app, listed in the Medicare App Library, uses a CMS-Aligned Network to find where a patient's records are and to fetch them. Every flow on it ends the same way: each data holder, knowing the app and its key, knowing the patient at IAL2, and knowing what she authorized, issues its own access token with the matched patient id. What varies is how those facts reach the data holder.*

The page shows one full flow, then three places where a deployment can do things differently. No version requires a [home network](apps-without-home-networks.md), and every version keeps token issuance at the data holder.

## Cast

| Actor | Role |
|---|---|
| **BP Buddy** | Patient-facing app, listed in the Medicare App Library and registered with the networks it uses (see How the app joins the ecosystem). |
| **Maria** | A patient with records at several organizations, identity-proofed once at an IAL2 CSP. |
| **IAL2 CSP** | CLEAR / ID.me. Proofed Maria once; later sign-ins against that identity are cheap federated authentications, not re-proofing. |
| **CMS App Library** | Lists vetted patient-facing apps and publishes a signed software statement for each. The statement is the app's identity everywhere on this page. |
| **The network** | A CMS-Aligned Network: its participating data holders plus a record location service. |
| **Data holders** | Each runs its own authorization server and FHIR endpoint, and issues its own access tokens. |

## What has to happen

Before a data holder releases anything, it has to know the app, know the patient at IAL2, and know what the patient authorized, and someone has to work out where the patient's records are. There are two ways to do the last three steps: with network-based permission tickets (blue) or with app-based client assertions (orange). The table near the end compares them.

![The app joins the ecosystem, the patient verifies her identity, someone records her grant and sees where her records are, and each data holder issues its own token, with a blue permission-ticket path and an orange client-assertion path](authorizing-access-logical.svg)

The app joins once per network, before any patient is involved; the next section covers how. Everything after that happens per patient.

## How the app joins the ecosystem

Getting into the Medicare App Library involves identity verification, conformance testing against an open reference kit, certification by a recognized body, and a check that the app controls its `jwks_uri`. From then on, CMS publishes a signed software statement for every active Library app: a short-lived JWT naming the app, its URIs, and its `jwks_uri`, and asserting its Library status ([example](example-artifacts/software-statement.md)). The statement pins the app's display name under the CMS signature, and it binds the app's keys by URL rather than by value, so the app rotates keys at its own `jwks_uri` without anyone re-issuing anything.

This page never puts an intermediary between the app and the parties it talks to. If we did pursue designs where a [home network](apps-without-home-networks.md) acts as one, we would need to develop protocols that accurately convey details about both the home network and the app throughout every flow, because the app is what patients recognize and what audit logs name. We avoid this complexity by modeling apps as direct participants in the ecosystem.

Once an app is listed in the Library, it can register with CMS-aligned networks. The app finds each network, its registration method, and its endpoints in the National Provider Directory. To count as CMS-aligned, a network must meet two functional requirements; how it meets them is up to the network, and the examples below show the range of mechanisms that qualify.

The first requirement is that the network must define a single mechanism through which an app can connect to every data holder in the network without doing work specific to any individual data holder. Manual steps are acceptable once per network, but never per data holder. This is what lets registration scale: however a network runs its front door, the layer behind it is automatic, so adding a data holder creates no new work for apps, and registering takes a bounded amount of work per network rather than per organization.

The second requirement is that the mechanism must not add to an app's cost of participating in individual access; if it involves certificates or other credentials, the network ensures apps can obtain them without paying. Registration ends with the app holding a client_id that the network's data holders recognize, and with each of them able to resolve the app's keys from its `jwks_uri`.

Three patterns cover the methods networks are likely to document. They are examples rather than a closed list: a network can document something else, so long as it meets the same two requirements.

### Once per network, through a developer portal

A human registers once for the whole network. The portal pre-fills its form from the CMS statement and verifies one signature instead of re-vetting the app; what its ad-hoc verification looks like is the network's business, and the spec should leave it unspecified. A network can also run this pattern with a different front door, forwarding dynamic registration requests from any of its data holders to the central registry and syncing the resulting client out to the rest.

    Portal->>Dev: Ad-hoc verification, per network policy<br/>(e.g. domain-ownership challenge or key-possession proof)

    Dev-->>Portal: Provide details
    Portal->>NAS: Provision registration
    NAS-->>Dev: client_id (recognized at all participating data holders)
```

*Example artifacts: [registration through a developer portal](example-artifacts/portal-registration.md).*

### At each data holder, presenting the CMS software statement

The app presents the CMS statement at each data holder's RFC 7591 registration endpoint, and a client library performs the calls in a loop, so the larger count costs nothing manual. The network may run its own onboarding first, with as much manual review as its policy requires, or skip that layer and let the CMS statement carry the decision; its data holders consult the approval signal automatically. The statement pins the app's display name and URIs under the CMS signature, which closes a gap seen in certificate schemes where any credentialed app can register under any name it likes.

    participant CMS as CMS App Library

    opt network-level onboarding (may be manual, may be skipped)
        App->>Net: Request onboarding<br/>(link to CMS software statement)
        Net->>CMS: Fetch and verify the statement
        Net->>Net: Internal review per network policy<br/>(opaque to apps, possibly manual)

    end
    App->>CMS: GET software-statement.jwt
    CMS-->>App: software_statement
    loop for each data holder, automated
        App->>DH: POST /register (RFC 7591, software_statement)
        DH->>DH: verifies CMS signature, library_status,<br/>key possession, approval signal (if any)
        DH-->>App: client_id at that data holder
    end
```

*Example artifacts: [dynamic registration with the CMS statement](example-artifacts/dynamic-registration.md) and [the software statement itself](example-artifacts/software-statement.md).*

### At each data holder, presenting a community-issued certificate

The network's community CA issues the app a certificate, with vetting per the network's policy that can lean on the same CMS Library evidence, and UDAP dynamic registration proceeds at each data holder from there. Certificate processes are where costs most often creep in, so the second requirement above bears repeating: a network that chooses a CA-based flow makes sure that getting certificates adds nothing to an app's cost of participating in individual access. Issued certificates have to track the app's `jwks_uri` automatically (see Keys over time below).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant App as BP Buddy
    participant CA as Trust-community CA
    participant DH as Data holder<br/>auth servers

    App->>CA: Certificate request, once per network and possibly manual<br/>(community vetting per network policy, leaning<br/>on the same CMS Library evidence)
    CA-->>App: X.509 certificate
    loop for each data holder, automated
        App->>DH: UDAP dynamic registration<br/>(RFC 7591, software statement signed with X.509 key)
        DH->>DH: Validate chain to the community CA
        DH-->>App: client_id at that data holder
    end
```

*Example artifacts: [registration with a community-issued certificate](example-artifacts/certificate-registration.md).*

### Keys over time

The app's keys live at its `jwks_uri` and rotate there on the app's own schedule. The CMS statement binds the URL, not a key, so rotation needs no re-issuance anywhere: data holders resolve the app's current keys at token time by `kid`, and the app publishes a new key alongside the old for an overlap window, starts signing with the new `kid`, and retires the old one.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant App as BP Buddy
    participant JWKS as bpbuddy.example/.well-known/jwks.json
    participant CMS as CMS App Library (monitor)
    participant DH as Any data holder auth server

    App->>JWKS: Publish key B alongside key A (overlap window)
    CMS->>JWKS: Routine monitoring (URI still serves a valid JWKS)
    App->>DH: Token request signed with kid=B
    DH->>JWKS: Resolve kid=B at the live jwks_uri
    DH-->>App: access_token (rotation invisible to the trust layer)
    App->>JWKS: Retire key A after overlap window
```

*Example artifacts: [key rotation, with the JWKS before and during the overlap window](example-artifacts/key-rotation.md).*

Credentials that a network or a trust community issues to the app (the certificate method above) have to track the `jwks_uri` automatically; if re-syncing means emailing someone, rotation has turned into a manual per-network step.

## The permission-ticket flow

This expands the blue path from the figure. A shared authorization service captures the grant: a party trusted by the network to do so, though not necessarily operated by it. It may be the network's own service, a portal vendor, or another party the network's data holders recognize, and it can run record location lookups against its own network and against peer networks it has agreements with.

### Signing Maria in

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant App as BP Buddy
    participant CSP as IAL2 CSP
    participant SAS as Shared authorization service

    App->>CSP: sends Maria to sign in<br/>(the app is the CSP's relying party)
    CSP-->>App: IAL2 id_token
    App->>SAS: opens the authorization step<br/>(code flow with PKCE, carrying the id_token as a hint)
    SAS->>CSP: silent re-authentication via id_token_hint<br/>(no screen if Maria's CSP session is live)
    CSP-->>SAS: fresh id_token, audienced to the service
```

*Example artifacts: [the CSP sign-in](example-artifacts/csp-sign-in.md) and [opening the authorization step](example-artifacts/authorization-step.md).*

1. BP Buddy signs Maria in at her IAL2 CSP itself: the app is the CSP's relying party and bears the proofing relationship. (The proofing cost was paid once; later sign-ins against that identity are cheap federated authentications.)
2. The app opens the authorization step at the shared authorization service (a standard SMART App Launch code flow with PKCE), already holding Maria's id_token, which it passes as a hint. The request also carries the app's Library-backed identity, so the service knows exactly which app is asking without any prior relationship.
3. The service re-authenticates Maria silently against the CSP using the hint: no screen if her CSP session is live, no re-proofing ever, and the service receives a fresh id_token audienced to itself. (Whether ecosystem re-authentication is priced at zero is a CSP participation-terms question worth exploring, not an architecture question.)

A service can also skip the re-authentication and accept the app-passed id_token itself as the sign-in. That token is automatically verifiable and audience-bound to the app, and accepting it is the same trust model the client-assertion flow runs on. It is an honest option provided it is named for what it is: it proves the app holds a recent assertion about Maria, not that Maria is present in this browser. A service accepting it should say so rather than implying a separation it does not deliver.

### Locating her records

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Maria
    participant App as BP Buddy
    participant SAS as Shared authorization service

    SAS->>SAS: record location lookup: its own network,<br/>plus peer networks it has agreements with
    SAS->>Maria: shows the matches<br/>Maria narrows sites and data categories
    SAS-->>App: token response: per-site permission tickets<br/>+ endpoint hints
```

*Example artifacts: [record location at a peer network](example-artifacts/peer-record-location.md) and [the token response carrying per-site tickets](example-artifacts/issuance-token-response.md).*

4. The service looks up where Maria has records: its own network's data holders, plus peer networks it has agreements with. The patient-facing screen is the right place for this lookup to live, because whoever presents the choices needs to know what the choices are.
5. Maria sees the matches and narrows them: which sites, which data categories. Sites she leaves out are never disclosed to the app, either as hints or as tickets. Service-side selection is the only placement where "the app never learns I was ever there" is achievable.
6. The token response back to the app carries one signed permission ticket per chosen site plus endpoint hints ([SMART Permission Tickets, proposal 003](https://build.fhir.org/ig/jmandel/smart-permission-tickets-wip/proposal-003-smart-launch-issuance.html)). Each ticket binds the grant: Maria's demographics, her identity evidence, the authorized scope, the site it is for, and the app's key.

### Tokens from each data holder

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant App as BP Buddy
    participant DH as Data holders (each one)

    loop for each site Maria chose
        App->>DH: redeems that site's ticket<br/>(app key + ticket, RFC 8693)
        DH-->>App: access token + matched patient id
        App->>DH: FHIR queries
    end
```

*Example artifacts: [redeeming a ticket through to FHIR retrieval](example-artifacts/permission-ticket.md).*

7. At each data holder, the app presents its key and that site's ticket (RFC 8693 token exchange). The data holder verifies the ticket signature, independently verifies the identity evidence inside it, runs its own patient match, applies its own policy, and issues its own access token with the matched patient id.
8. FHIR queries proceed with each data holder's token. A still-valid ticket can be re-presented for a fresh token; expired tickets are renewed at the service with a refresh token, without re-running the authorization step.

There is no `$rls` call by the app anywhere in this story: record location happened inside the authorization step, and the app received its answer as tickets.

## The client-assertion flow

This expands the orange path: the flow CMS documents for Blue Button, where the app attests the grant itself. `cms_smart` is the extension it uses ([Blue Button's CMS Aligned Networks flow](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/cms-aligned-networks-documentation/)): a `client_credentials` grant whose signed `client_assertion` carries a `purpose_of_use` (`PATRQT` for patient access) and the patient's IAL2 id_token. "What Maria authorized" rests on the app's own assertion, backed by Library vetting, and Maria never leaves the app. It is the floor the ecosystem already documents. The separation at stake: a shared service recording the grant has no financial stake in the data flowing, while the app receiving the data does, and CMS's own position that a CSP should not learn sites of care draws the same kind of line between roles. Nothing mandates the separation; the matrix below is the accounting.

### Signing Maria in

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant App as BP Buddy
    participant CSP as IAL2 CSP

    App->>CSP: sends Maria to sign in<br/>(the app is the CSP's relying party)
    CSP-->>App: IAL2 id_token<br/>(carried inside every call below)
```

*Example artifacts: [the CSP sign-in](example-artifacts/csp-sign-in.md).*

The sign-in is identical to the blue path, and it is the only place Maria proves who she is: there is no second stop. The id_token does not stay behind at any service; the app carries it inside every `cms_smart` call it makes from here.

### Locating her records

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Maria
    participant App as BP Buddy
    participant NAS as Network auth server
    participant RLS as Network RLS

    App->>NAS: POST /token: client_credentials + client_assertion<br/>cms_smart: purpose_of_use PATRQT, IAL2 id_token
    NAS-->>App: access_token bound to Maria, RLS scope
    App->>RLS: POST Patient/$rls
    RLS-->>App: locations holding Maria's records
    App->>Maria: shows every location found
    Maria->>App: deselects sites in the app
```

*Example artifacts: [the client_credentials token and $rls call](example-artifacts/client-credentials-rls.md).*

`$rls` stands in for a record location operation whose wire shape is still an open question. Maria has the same control over what data flows as in the blue path. The difference is what the app learns: it has already seen every care relationship (the behavioral health clinic, the reproductive health clinic) before Maria chooses, and no in-app control can undo that disclosure. (The disclosure is the same if a ticket-issuing service skips its own screen and returns everything: [a blanket ticket and the full hint list](example-artifacts/blanket-ticket.md).)

### Tokens from each data holder

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant App as BP Buddy
    participant DH as Data holder auth server

    App->>DH: POST /token: client_credentials + client_assertion<br/>cms_smart: purpose_of_use PATRQT, IAL2 id_token
    DH-->>App: access_token bound to Maria, matched patient id
```

*Example artifacts: [the cms_smart token request at a data holder](example-artifacts/cms-smart-data-holder.md).*

The data holder's verification work is nearly identical to the blue path: client key against the Library-verified `jwks_uri`, identity evidence, its own patient match. What shifts is the attestation of scope: a ticket carries what an independent party recorded Maria authorizing; the `cms_smart` call carries what the app asserts she authorized. Notably, a deployment can adopt the authorization step while its data holders implement only the `cms_smart` call; the service's record of the grant exists even where it is not yet presented, which makes this a natural transition stage. Continued access also differs: here, data holders may issue refresh tokens under the can-spec's rolling 90-day window; on the ticket path, a still-valid ticket is simply presented again, and expired tickets are renewed at the service.

## Comparing the paths

Rows are criteria; the text in each cell describes what that path looks like from that criterion. The colors and marks are a first pass at scoring: ✓ favorable, ± mixed, ✗ unfavorable. The text should be uncontroversial; the scoring is the debatable part, and debating it is the point.

<table class="dm">
<thead><tr><th></th><th class="hb">network-based permission tickets</th><th class="ho">app-based client assertions</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><th>Who records what Maria agreed to share</th><td class="g">a shared authorization service, on its own screen</td><td class="y">the app, in its own UI, backed by Library vetting</td></tr>

<tr><th>How Maria revokes</th><td class="g">once, at the service; status reaches credentials derived from the ticket</td><td class="r">per app, and per data holder</td></tr>
<tr><th>What the audit trail holds</th><td class="g">the ticket itself: which app, which grant, signed</td><td class="y">the data holder's log of the app's call and its asserted purpose</td></tr>
<tr><th>How coverage grows</th><td class="g">the service adds peer networks; Maria's stops shrink toward one</td><td class="y">the app integrates each network's record location itself</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A transition mix is workable where the cells suggest it: a service-recorded grant presented to data holders as `cms_smart` asks data holders for only the smaller change, while everything else scores like the tickets column. That decoupling is what makes it a deployment stage rather than a destination.
